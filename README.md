> Currently in beta. While functional, there may still be large changes or obvious bugs.

If you have any feedback, bug reports, or suggestions, I welcome you to [open an issue](https://github.com/ValerioLyndon/Theme-Customiser/issues). If you found this useful or have more casual comments, you can let me know on my [MyAnimeList profile](http://myanimelist.net/profile/Valerio_Lyndon).

## Using the Customiser

**As a user,** you can utilise the customiser by visiting the link above or by finding designers linking to it in the wild.

**As a list designer,** please check [the wiki](https://github.com/ValerioLyndon/Theme-Customiser/wiki) for tutorials on using it with your themes.

## Created your own collection?

If you've created a collection JSON for your own themes, I'd love to know! You are of course free to use the collection with the customiser as you please, but if you would like it included in official colleciton links so more users can see and install your themes then please contact me about it or open an issue requesting the change. I will not guarantee it will be added, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

## Contributing

If you enjoy this project and want to help improve it, feel free to make a pull request! Try to keep formatting similar where you can, especially with CSS spacing and selectors, but there isn't a hard set of formatting rules you have to follow.

If you have feedback on the format or naming of theme JSON or are planning anything big, it's probably best to open an issue and discuss it first.
