## About

A tool to felicitate easier customisation and installation of list designs for MyAnimeList.

View it in action on Github Pages: [Link](https://valeriolyndon.github.io/Theme-Customiser/)

> Currently in a beta state. It works, but it has a lot of improvements to be made!

If you have any feedback, bug reports, or suggestions, I welcome you to [open an issue](https://github.com/ValerioLyndon/Theme-Customiser/issues). If you found this useful or have more casual comments, you can let me know on my [MyAnimeList profile](http://myanimelist.net/profile/Valerio_Lyndon).

## Using the Customiser

As a user, you can use the customiser by finding links to it on MyAnimeList or anywhere else. I am currently in the process of adopting it for all of [my own themes](https://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=805506).

As a list designer, please check ["Creating your own data.json"](https://github.com/ValerioLyndon/Theme-Customiser/wiki/Creating-your-own-data.json) on the wiki.

## Contributing

If you enjoy this project and want to help improve it, feel free to make a pull request! Try to keep formatting similar where you can, especially with CSS spacing and selectors, but there isn't a hard set of formatting rules you have to follow.

If you have feedback on the format or naming of theme JSON or are planning anything big, it's probably best to open an issue and discuss it first.
