## Using the Customiser

**As a user,** you can utilise the customiser by visiting the [default collection](https://valeriolyndon.github.io/Theme-Customiser/) or by finding designers linking to it in the wild.

**As a list designer,** please check [the wiki](https://github.com/ValerioLyndon/Theme-Customiser/wiki) for tutorials on using it with your themes.

## Created your own JSON?

If you've created a theme or collection JSON of your own, I'd love to know! You are, of course, free to use them with the customiser as you please by using the URL parameters. If you want it included in official collection links so that more users can see and install your themes then please contact me about it or open an issue requesting the change. I do not guarantee it will be added as there are certain requisites to meet regarding user-friendliness, but I would love to say yes.

## Contributing

If you enjoy this project and want to help improve it, feel free to make a pull request! Try to keep formatting similar where you can, especially with CSS spacing and selectors, but there isn't a hard set of formatting rules you have to follow.

If you have feedback on the format or naming of theme JSON or are planning anything big, it's probably best to open an issue and discuss it first.
